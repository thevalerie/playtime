# PlayTime

PlayTime is a tool to help fitness instructors create the perfect playlist for every class.  Using OAuth2 protocols, a user can log in via their Spotify account to connect their playlists. They then create custom categories, profiles for different types of songs which allow a user to specify a range for duration, tempo, energy level, and/or other qualitative criteria. Categories can be applied to existing playlists, which can then be edited directly in the app. If a user needs some inspiration, they can request recommendations based on their custom category, and PlayTime will use the specifications provided by the user, the songs they already like, and Spotify's API to provide a list of new songs that perfectly match their needs.
